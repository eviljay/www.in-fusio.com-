   Schlumberger has joined forces with French start-up, In Fusio, to
   deliver interactive games on Mobile Phones over GSM networks.
   Through the use of Java technology, the Cyberflex Simera SIM card,
   the AREMIS application management server, and a back-office game
   server, In Fusio and Schlumberger deliver a complete solution that
   enables subscribers to select and download games remotely and to
   play games in true multi-player interactivity mode. This offer
   will provide Mobile Operators with an extremely powerful tool for
   targeting specific subscriber segments in order to increase
   loyalty and airtime usage.<BR>
   <BR>
   This arrangement clearly demonstrates the benefits of Schlumberger
   Cyberflex Mobile Solution, enabling In Fusio to rapidly design and
   implement innovative and creative game solutions into the mobile
   environment.<BR>
   <BR>
   The two companies will be demonstrating the games, SIM cards and
   back-office application servers for the first time at the GSM
   World Congress, Cannes, February 23rd to 25th.<BR>
   <BR>
   The advent of dedicated modern games stations, multi-media PCs,
   high quality graphics and interactive capabilities has profoundly
   changed the model of the games market. . New portable devices have
   spurred significant growth in the pocket games market, creating a
   new opportunity for introducing similar games on mobile phone
   terminals.<BR>
   <BR>
   "We belong to a leisure world. Despite the success of new 32 bits
   and 64 bits consoles, video games are still a taboo for most of
   the adults. With a world-wide installed base of more than 40
   millions of consoles and 70 millions of pocket consoles, facts
   show the hidden mass market needs for video games !", notes Gilles
   Raymond, In Fusio Managing Director. "With the power of the
   Schlumberger Cyberflex Simera SIM card, we can offer operators the
   means to reduce the hardware in the subscriber's pocket and to
   increase the range of games available while providing real
   multi-player interactivity on a GSM phone for the first time".<BR>
   <BR>
   Until now, games have either been built directly into the mobile
   phone - which did not allow much flexibility - or required
   continuous airtime connections to games servers managed by the
   network operator. The Schlumberger/In Fusio approach is different.
   The Cyberflex Simera Java SIM card provides a flexible,
   programmable platform for games. The AREMIS Application Management
   server enables remote download, activation, customization and
   billing of games. In Fusio's interactive game server addresses the
   content and multi-player features with centralised score and
   multiple player management capabilities.<BR>
   <BR>
   "Mobile phones are definitely a modern lifestyle element but to
   which are associated major churn problems", comments Stephan le
   Gentil, Product Line Manager for SIM cards at Schlumberger Test
   &amp; Transactions. "Operators can target subscriber sectors
   effectively, and combat churn, by offering a portfolio of games
   similar to those available on pocket stations but with the
   advantages of 'load, play, and trash', multi-player competition
   and interactivity."<BR>
   <BR>
   "Real over-the-air interactivity offers a new dimension to the
   mobile games industry", notes Robert Lezec, Vice President,
   Schlumberger Mobile Communications Solutions Group. "Mobile
   network operators who embrace this new dimension will open up a
   completely new market and see their businesses grow, especially
   with cost effective solutions like this"<BR>
   <BR>
   The Simera SIM card is compatible with the pro-active commands of
   the latest Phase 2+ SIM Application toolkit, allowing the
   computing power of the chip to be used to independently run
   sophisticated application programs - including games that interact
   with the subscriber via the keyboard and display, and communicate
   with the server using the short message system (SMS). SMS provides
   the key to delivering a cost effective solution. The subscriber
   downloads the game onto the card, plays, and communicates with the
   server only to send answers to questions, update high score tables
   or load 'next move' commands in multi-player role-playing games.
   When finished - or bored - with a game, the subscriber can contact
   the server to download a new game, effectively providing almost
   unlimited download capacity. In Fusio is already developing quiz
   and memory games as well as a multi-player 'plateau' game called
   Spirit. All SMS communication occurs automatically, eliminating
   the subscriber's need to either maintain a connection or to
   repeatedly place a call, making it easier and cheaper to play
   games in a concentrated fashion.<BR>
