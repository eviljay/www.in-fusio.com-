    Kingdom), Alcatel, Schlumberger, also attracting players on the PC market 
    such as Packard Bell. In-Fusio has also begun its international expansion

    <br>
    In-Fusio offers a wide range of games and services with added value on mobile 
    telephones, and has developed specific solutions for mobile telephony operators 
    who want to offer their subscribers on-line " virtual competitions ", such 
    as the creation of tailor-made on-line games and the management of their interactivity, 
    the management of the web sites dedicated to these games or the creation of 
    " competition games " in the form of " virtual competitions ".<br>
    <br>
    " On the strength of its established base of millions of mobile telephone 
    users, France Telecom is a prime partner for our company. " comments Gilles 
    Raymond, CEO of In-Fusio. " Wishing to offer its subscribers a permanent range 
    of attractive, high quality, innovative products, France Telecom very quickly 
    understood the interest of our interactive games, which are a source of additional 
    revenue, but above all differentiate the company and build up customer loyalty. 
    "<BR>
    <BR>
    " We undertake to continuously offer our customers the latest technological 
    innovations as well as the high quality products that make France Telecom's

    new offering of interactive games via mobile phones " adds Guy Lafarge, Marcom 
    Director of France Telecom Mobiles. <br>
    <br>
    <b>Partnership with France Telecom<br>
    </b>Available from 23rd March, the In-Fusio interactive games will be offered 
    by France Telecom to Mobicarte customers with mct Arnette and Trium Laser 
    kits. The two games produced by In Fusio specifically for France Telecom are 
    " Push ", a puzzle game, and " Crazy Pet ", an upgraded maze game.<BR>
    <BR>
    In parallel, In-Fusio will provide France Telecom with complementary services 
    including the management of the games and of their interactivity and the development 
    and updating of the " Les Games " page on the France Telecom web site reserved 
    for interactive games. Players will be able to find the latest information 
    there, such as the list of winners, the highest scores, tricks and tips, gifts

    In this context, In-Fusio will set up partnerships for France Telecom associated 
    with the interactive games, Push et Crazy Pet, through on-line competitions.
