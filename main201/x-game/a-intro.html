  <DT>We belong to a leisure world. With a 20 billion USD turnover and a world-wide 
    installed base of more than 100 million consoles and 75 million pocket consoles, 
    these facts show the hidden mass market needs for video games! The mobile 
    phone has many assets to bring fun and pleasure to customers.</DT>
  <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
  <dt> In Fusio believes mobile phones will become to video game consoles what 
    the walkman is to Hi-fi. Like the pocketstation it fits the immediate need 
    to play at time killer applications or full time games.</dt>

<p>Over the air connection, through SMS channel or WAP, gives customers the opportunity 
  to play real interactive games whenever they want. It offers the capacity of 
  organising competitions by sending high scores, downloading new levels or upgrading 
  systems and also meeting other players from all over the world. Over the air 
  interactivity brings new dimensions to games. For the operator, more than a 
  source of profit, the Living Game Concept makes the mobile phone a daily tool, 
  increasing fidelity and pleasure. </p>
