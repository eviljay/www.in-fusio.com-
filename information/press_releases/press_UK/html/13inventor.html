        a new stage in the international development of In Fusio and is set to 
        be followed in the coming weeks by In Fusio's development on the American 
        market and on all other rapidly-expanding mobile telephony markets. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Created in 1998, the 
        company In Fusio has become the reference on the mobile phone games market 
        and has already signed a number of partnership agreements with major mobile

        a large range of added value games and services for mobile telephones 
        and has developed specific solutions for mobile telephony operators wanting 
        to offer connected " virtual competitions " to their subscribers, such

        or management of Internet sites dedicated to these games. In addition, 
        In Fusio also offers the implementation of " competition games " to operators,

        seized on the interest of added value services, such as In Fusio connected 
        games, which differentiate, federate and develop loyalty while also generating 
        traffic and additional revenue. Our offer enables them to propose a much 
        richer and more user-friendly tool than a simple telephone to their subscribers, 
        and to reach a young target through original connected games ", comments

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font color="#000000">Controlled 
        advertising: win subscribers and generate traffic</font></b> <br>
        In Fusio offers mobile telephony operators the implementation of advertising 
        operations associated with on-line games, by means of sponsoring/competition 
        games. Subject to the operator's agreement, they enable one or more sponsors 
        to promote their brand on the start-up of higher game levels, in exchange 
        for which they offer products/services to be won by players. In this way, 
        players can download the higher game levels directly from their operator's 
        site and participate in virtual competitions that are eligible for " prize 
        awards ". The operator's benefit lies in the subsequent increase in telephone 
        connections, therefore in income. The first " sponsors " of these virtual 
        competitions are scheduled to be announced during the first quarter of 
        2000. </font>

        BT for supply of the first GPRS-technology game to BT Cellnet, the operator's 
        mobile telephony subsidiary.</b> <br>
        In Fusio has developed for BT Cellnet, the mobile division of BT, the 
        first game based on the new GPRS - General Packet Radio Services - cordless 
        data linking technology, enabling reception of several hundred Kbit/s 
        levels on a mobile phone. Currently under testing, this game is called 
        " Football Plus ". Using their mobile phone, it enables players to select 
        their "winning" football team on the basis of actual players in the British 
        championship. Points are awarded to the player's selected team on the 
        basis of real results obtained by the clubs and individual player's performances. 
        On each day of the championship, the player can follow his team's development. 
        The team possessing the highest number of points becomes mathematically 
        the most powerful of the teams selected by the community of on-line players. 
        The In Fusio controlled advertising service then enables prizes to be 
        awarded to those players having selected the winning " Football Plus " 
        team of the virtual competition. </font>
