        ]  In-Fusio, Oberthur Gaming Technologies and Oberthur Card Systems are pleased to announce a newly formed consortium, established to provide a technologically secure solution for the provision of real-time lottery games, utilizing wireless mobile handsets.   </FONT>

Lotteries will now have the ability to utilize state of the art technology, while insuring the future growth of their business.  These features, combined with the added convenience to players, will enable the lottery sector to remain competitive in the years to come.  </FONT>
      <P align="left"><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In-Fusio, recognised as the pioneer in "Connected Mobile Games" and the first company to launch connected games on GSM mobile phones, brings an unrivalled expertise in mobile gaming to the collaboration.  By embarking on this new market and showing its ambition in M-gaming, In-Fusio also diversifies its own portfolio, already offering over 20 different games.</FONT>      
      <P align="left"><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oberthur Card Systems, the innovator in the smart card industry, and Oberthur Gaming Technologies, the global leader in the lottery market, are both divisions of the Fran¡ois Charles Oberthur Group.  This is the first time the two companies have worked together in the mobile communications sphere, benefiting from their respective areas of expertise to exploit the opportunities which mobile gaming offers.  </FONT>
      <P align="left"><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On selection of the lottery option from the menu of the mobile handset, a connection is made with In-Fusio's ExEn (Execution Engine).  This then enables the player to download any number of lottery specific games to his or her handset.  Having accepted to play the game, the player will then utilize the mobile phone to make their bet.  Whether it be choosing your Lotto Numbers or playing a scratch ticket, the player can play with the convenience of their mobile phone.  Once the player has completed the transaction, a confirmation is recorded on the established system, before the player receives a final confirmation.  </FONT>      
      <P align="left"><FONT size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mobile Gaming has long been prophesied as the inevitable waiting to happen.  One of the barriers to date, which has needed to be addressed in Mobile Gaming, is its need for a secure payment channel.  This has also been the case for the Internet industry.  Well now, the mobile industry has come up with a solution - the SIMChip ! </FONT>       
      <P align="left"><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The smart card has been recognised in many fields including e-business, mobile music and commerce as being the best medium to introduce a layer of security and online authentication with PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) and digital rights management into the mobile handset.  Oberthur's expertise in the digital rights management and smart card field combined with the counsel provided by Oberthur Gaming Technologies in the complex and diverse sphere of Lottery and Gaming rules, ensures that the collaboration with In-Fusio will provide the best secure m-gambling solution on the market.</FONT>
      <P align="left"><FONT size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Giles Corbett, Managing Director of Bordeaux-based In-Fusio said, "Combined, these three companies have all the ingredients and the competences required to offer national lotteries the first secure and gambling solution compatible with their existing on-line systems. The co-development of lotteries on mobiles with Oberthur will permit us to be the first to address the major issue of security. After being the pioneer of games for mobiles, In-Fusio will also be the pioneer of M-Gambling.  ."</FONT> 
      <P align="left"><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">St»phane Mouss», Head of Marketing for Mobile Communications at Oberthur Card Systems commented, "The Mobile phone has long been heralded as the ultimate lifestyle device for consumers, as their lifestyles become more and more mobile, so too must their hobbies.  Gaming has proven successful already in the realm of the Wired Internet and so it is a natural progression to open up this potential to the wireless one.  The smart card provides the key to this complex world involving rights management, payment and authentication and we are very pleased that we can work together with In-Fusio and our sister company, Oberthur Gaming Technology to lead the way in providing truly, secure mobile gambling."</FONT>
      <P align="left"><FONT size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">John Connelly, Vice-President Corporate Strategic Development at Oberthur Gaming Technologies concluded, "  "If you could imagine one place in the world where you would want to have a lottery retailer, you would probably say, "In someone's back pocket"!  Well, this is no longer an unrealistic dream, but a reality!  With the creation of this consortium, Oberthur will be able to offer the lottery industry a secure method of selling lottery tickets via a mobile phone.  We at Oberthur believe that Mobile Gaming will inevitably attract the next generation of lottery players, who for years have been migrating away from the lottery industry."</FONT>
