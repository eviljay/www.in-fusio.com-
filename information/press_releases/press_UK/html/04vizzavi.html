      <P align="left"><FONT size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In-Fusio, pioneer and leading supplier of connected mobile game solutions to telecom mobile operators signed an agreement for WAP games with Vizzavi Ltd., the new multi-access European portal.</FONT>
      <P align="left"><FONT size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In-Fusio announces the recent launching of two popular games for Vizzavi, the rapidly growing 50/50 joint venture between Vodafone Group plc and Vivendi Universal.</FONT>
      <P align="left"><FONT size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The two WAP-based games are Football Fans, a fantasy football game, and Quizz, a general knowledge game. Both have been available to members of the Vizzavi UK portal (www.vizzavi.co.uk) since December 2000. They will soon be available on the other Vizzavi portals in Europe.</FONT>
      <P align="left"><FONT size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Football Fans has been developed exclusively for Vizzavi and lets a player manage his own football team. To set up a fantasy team, the manager has to select 11 football players from any of the Premier League clubs. The manager's fantasy team will then gain points according to the real performance of each of his football players. It's like the real thing - the manager can even do player transfers. </FONT>
      <P align="left"><FONT size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Quizz features four general knowledge categories: Art, Science, History and News. The questions are asked at random with answers chosen from a multiple choice. If a player gets three correct answers in any category, he wins a golden coin. Collect a golden coin for every category and a bonus of 10 golden coins is awarded. Each week, players are ranked according to their scores and the winner is the player with the highest score.</FONT>
