        deployment of this mobile game downloading application. </b></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="textegras">Bordeaux, July 3, 2001</span> 
        <span class="texte">&#151; &quot;The future is not in five years time, 
        but it is today, and what we are doing today with In-Fusio is simply revolutionary&quot; 
        publicly announced Guy Lafarge, Executive Marketing and Communication 
        Director of Orange France. Hot on the heels of downloadable ring tones, 
        videogames can now be sent directly to your mobile phone!</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="texte">Ten months after announcing its revolutionary 
        ExEn technology, In-Fusio, pioneer in games for cellular phones, has delivered 
        to Orange a whole catalogue of downloadable video games, launched this 
        week (see the attached the list of games).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="texte">Created and developed by In-Fusio, ExEn&reg; 
        (Execution Engine) is an application embedded in the terminals, allowing 
        the user to download games in complete freedom. ExEn today provides the 
        best real-time video interface, also managing sound, colour and 3D animated 
        graphics. Uniquely dedicated to gaming, it uses eight times less memory, 
        yet runs twelve times faster than other general-purpose virtual machines. 
        Once downloaded, In-Fusio games are played on the phone, without the need 
        for a permanent network connection. </p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="texte">ExEn can be installed in most types 
        of cellular phones and runs on existing networks and billing systems without 
        any upgrades. According to Giles Corbett, Managing Director of In-Fusio, 
        this is one of the key arguments in favour of this technology: "ExEn games 
        are attractive to operators, because they offer a perspective of short-term 
        revenues, in line with the philosophy of a market tainted by the disappointment 
        with WAP. After the launch of our first games in April 2000, we saw a 
        usage rate of 64% among cellular phone owners! To date, no other application 
        has achieved such results."</span></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="textegras"><b>Towards a standardized technology 
        for all players in the mobile gaming world.</b></span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="texte">Sold on the quality of ExEn's graphics 
        and animation, the game studios Kalisto and Cyronetworks are collaborating 
        with In-Fusio in order to offer new products to the mobile gaming world. 
        One of the games, Tinies, created by Kalisto, is ready and already included 
        in the launch catalogue.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="texte">Thanks to ExEn, big names in entertainment 
        are also open to games for cellular phones. The licensing agreement recently 
        signed by Universal Studios and In-Fusio has resulted in the animated 
        game Jurassic Park III, which follows on directly from the famous dinosaur 
        saga. This game is available to operators and is included in the initial 
        games catalogue .</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="texte">In-Fusio entered into a decisive 
        phase last May when it announced the development of a standard Java<font face="Symbol">&#212;</font> 
        programming interface (API) for mobile games with Motorola, the second 
        largest manufacturer of cellular phones in the world: &quot;The expertise 
        and the experience acquired by In-Fusio with its ExEn technology and by 
        Motorola with Java<font face="Symbol">&#212;</font> will simplify the 
        development of games for mobiles and impose the reality of this new market, 
        available to application developers," stated Gilles Raymond, CEO and founder 
        of In-Fusio.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="texte">While waiting for this new interface 
        and in order to meet the expectations of the players in the market, In-Fusio 
        is pursuing its deployment of ExEn.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="texte">In the coming months, no fewer than four 
        manufacturers (of which two have already been announced, Philips and Trium) 
        will have integrated ExEn into their mobile phones. </p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="texte">After the world premiere with Orange, several 
        major European and Asian operators will proceed with the launch of ExEn 
        games this summer.</p>
