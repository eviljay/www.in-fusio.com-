        Motorola and In-Fusio have signed an agreement to jointly develop a new games application programming interface (API) for mobile phones. This new client-side interface represents a milestone in the mobile games industry. The advanced API is being designed to help game developers create more compelling games for JavaTM technology-enabled mobile communication products and other wireless devices that deliver fast action and highly attractive graphics.. </FONT>
      <P align="left"><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To compete with popular video games, mobile devices need to offer games with appealing features and an eye-catching appearance. "The market opportunity for mobile games is tremendous. Games provide a rigorous environment for testing software architectures, and they quickly raise market awareness for the entire value chain of mobile communication products," says Anne-Marie Larkin, vice president and director of Motorola's Wireless Software Applications and Services.  "A unique standardized games API will give developers a consistent framework from which to write compelling, fun programs that consumers can download to Java technology-enabled handsets."  . </FONT>
      <P align="left"><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The games API is designed to enhance the capabilities of Java technology-enabled handsets and is expected to be fully compliant with the versions of Java technology dedicated to mobile phones (J2METM, CLDC, MIDP). </FONT>
