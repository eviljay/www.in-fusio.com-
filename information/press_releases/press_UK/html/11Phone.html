              Phone.com, Inc. (Nasdaq:PHCM), a leading provider of mobile Internet 
              software, applications and services, today announced collaborative 
              relationships with key Internet content partners to broadly enable 
              a new class of location-based applications.<br>
              Phone.com will work with Amazon.com for location sensitive m-Commerce, 
              DoubleClick (Nasdaq: DCLK) to enable location-based advertising, 
              In-Fusio for location-based games, and Go2Systems for community 
              and content applications.<br>
              <br>
              Wireless software developers have relied upon Phone.com's software 
              developer program and technology to format their content for mobile 
              phones in a reliable, cost-effective manner for over four years. 
              The introduction of the Phone.comÙ Mobile Location Server and reflects 
              the company's commitment to furthering the wireless Internet, providing 
              developers with the tools necessary for building more enhanced applications. 
              Phone.com is working together with the leading applications providers 
              to develop and promote the Phone.com location technology as the 
              preferred platform for developing location-based Internet applications.<br>
              <br>
              "Phone.com's location solution takes a leadership role in ensuring 
              strong subscriber protection through privacy management, access 
              controls, and other identity protecting capabilities, assuring end 
              users that their location information is fully protected, " said 
              Mark Hopper, senior product marketing manager for Phone.com. "Providing 
              this kind of assurance enables wireless carriers and content providers 
              to focus on business operations and brand management."<br>
              <br>
              "Phone.com sets an important precedent for the management of user 
              privacy for the wireless Internet by requiring companies to request 
              a consumer's permission before their location may be used," said 
              Jamie Byrne, Director of Emerging Platforms, DoubleClick. "By giving 
              consumers control of the usage of their data, the Mobile Location 
              Server protects user privacy while providing carriers, wireless 
              publishers and companies like DoubleClick with the tools to deliver 
              highly targeted and relevant content, services and advertising. 
              We look forward to working with Phone.com and privacy groups to 
              ensure wireless advertising meets the standards of fair information 
              practices."<br>
              <br>
              "Wireless shopping allows customers to shop wherever and whenever 
              they want. Amazon and Phone.com are collaborating to enable the 
              easiest and most location relevant purchase engine for mobile shoppers. 
              Either through online purchases or in support of our partners, Amazon 
              is in an exciting position to drive location sensitive m-Commerce," 
              says Ali Hussein, Director of Marketing and Business Development, 
              Amazon Anywhere.<br>
              <br>
              "We are delighted to be a part of Phone.com's Mobile Location Server 
              API," said Go2 founder and president, Lee Hancock. "As Go2 Systems 
              continues its lead in developing and providing location-based wireless 
              content, this new alliance allows Go2 even greater distribution 
              for its location-centric products and services."<br>
              <br>
              "Gaming is a universal killer application and now one of the hottest 
              areas for wireless Internet," commented Giles Corbett, managing 
              director of In-fusio, the Mobile Fun CompanyÙ. "Given the small 
              screen size, and the intrinsic mobility of the devices, our gamers 
              now want to turn the world into their playing field-this is precisely 
              what a new generation of games designed with the mobile location 
              API will enable us to do."<br>
