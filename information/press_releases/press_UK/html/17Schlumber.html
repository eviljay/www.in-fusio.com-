              has joined forces with French start-up, In Fusio, to deliver interactive 
              games on Mobile Phones over GSM networks. Through the use of Java 
              technology, the Cyberflex Simera SIM card, the AREMIS application 
              management server, and a back-office game server, In Fusio and Schlumberger 
              deliver a complete solution that enables subscribers to select and 
              download games remotely and to play games in true multi-player interactivity 
              mode. This offer will provide Mobile Operators with an extremely 
              powerful tool for targeting specific subscriber segments in order 
              to increase loyalty and airtime usage.</font> 
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
              arrangement clearly demonstrates the benefits of Schlumberger Cyberflex 
              Mobile Solution, enabling In Fusio to rapidly design and implement 
              innovative and creative game solutions into the mobile environment.</font> 
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              two companies will be demonstrating the games, SIM cards and back-office 
              application servers for the first time at the GSM World Congress, 
              Cannes, February 23rd to 25th.</font> 
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              advent of dedicated modern games stations, multi-media PCs, high 
              quality graphics and interactive capabilities has profoundly changed 
              the model of the games market. . New portable devices have spurred 
              significant growth in the pocket games market, creating a new opportunity 
              for introducing similar games on mobile phone terminals.</font> 
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We 
              belong to a leisure world. Despite the success of new 32 bits and 
              64 bits consoles, video games are still a taboo for most of the 
              adults. With a world-wide installed base of more than 40 millions 
              of consoles and 70 millions of pocket consoles, facts show the hidden 
              mass market needs for video games !", notes Gilles Raymond, In Fusio 
              Managing Director. "With the power of the Schlumberger Cyberflex 
              Simera SIM card, we can offer operators the means to reduce the 
              hardware in the subscriber's pocket and to increase the range of 
              games available while providing real multi-player interactivity 
              on a GSM phone for the first time".</font> 
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Until 
              now, games have either been built directly into the mobile phone 
              - which did not allow much flexibility - or required continuous 
              airtime connections to games servers managed by the network operator. 
              The Schlumberger/In Fusio approach is different. The Cyberflex Simera 
              Java SIM card provides a flexible, programmable platform for games. 
              The AREMIS Application Management server enables remote download, 
              activation, customization and billing of games. In Fusio's interactive 
              game server addresses the content and multi-player features with 
              centralised score and multiple player management capabilities.</font> 
            
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mobile 
          phones are definitely a modern lifestyle element but to which are associated 
          major churn problems", comments Stephan le Gentil, Product Line Manager 
          for SIM cards at Schlumberger Test &amp; Transactions. "Operators can 
          target subscriber sectors effectively, and combat churn, by offering 
          a portfolio of games similar to those available on pocket stations but 
          with the advantages of 'load, play, and trash', multi-player competition 
          and interactivity."</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Real 
          over-the-air interactivity offers a new dimension to the mobile games 
          industry", notes Robert Lezec, Vice President, Schlumberger Mobile Communications 
          Solutions Group. "Mobile network operators who embrace this new dimension 
          will open up a completely new market and see their businesses grow, 
          especially with cost effective solutions like this"</font> 
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              Simera SIM card is compatible with the pro-active commands of the 
              latest Phase 2+ SIM Application toolkit, allowing the computing 
              power of the chip to be used to independently run sophisticated 
              application programs - including games that interact with the subscriber 
              via the keyboard and display, and communicate with the server using 
              the short message system (SMS). SMS provides the key to delivering 
              a cost effective solution. The subscriber downloads the game onto 
              the card, plays, and communicates with the server only to send answers 
              to questions, update high score tables or load 'next move' commands 
              in multi-player role-playing games. When finished - or bored - with 
              a game, the subscriber can contact the server to download a new 
              game, effectively providing almost unlimited download capacity. 
              In Fusio is already developing quiz and memory games as well as 
              a multi-player 'plateau' game called Spirit. All SMS communication 
              occurs automatically, eliminating the subscriber's need to either 
              maintain a connection or to repeatedly place a call, making it easier 
              and cheaper to play games in a concentrated fashion.</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
