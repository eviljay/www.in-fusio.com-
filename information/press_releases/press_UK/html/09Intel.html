        working with Intel to develop a new <br>

        </font></b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On 
        August 23, 2000 during the Intel Developer Forum, in San Jose, California, 
        Intel will unveil its new Flash Data Integrator 3.0 software (FDI 3.0). 
        This software manages code and data stored in flash memory. Intel has 
        chosen to work with In-Fusio to demonstrate the performance of its FDI 
        (Flash Data Integrator) technology with In-Fusio's gaming software.<br>
        <br>
        "Intel is excited to be working with In-Fusio, one of the leaders in the 
        cellular gaming world. We expect this effort to optimize the memory usage 
        in cellular gaming applications as well as open the door for new In-Fusio 
        games that benefit from FDI's Java and Java-like XIP capabilities," said 
        Gary Forni, software manager of Intel's Flash Products Group.</font>
      <p align="left">
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Intel's 
        new flash memory manager is particularly well adapted to mobile terminals, 
        allowing service developers to get products to market more quickly. "More 
        than any other service, games must be available in the shortest timescale 
        possible. Thanks to Intel's technology, the deployment of a game will 
        be much quicker and will therefore reduce the production costs. Moreover, 
        the use of a FDI-managed flash memory provides large storage capacity 
        and performance, opening up new horizons for the development of mobile 
        phone games," emphasizes Giles Corbett, Managing Director of In-Fusio.</font>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In fact, 
        with FDI, games which require speed for processing and interactivity, 
        such as Tetris or 3D labyrinth, will be easily adaptable to Intel's flash 
        memory, whereas they would have been far too slow to run in WAP environment. 
        For the player, there are also considerable advantages to the In-Fusio/Intel 
        relationship. Now a player can manage his games' portfolio by adding, 
        deleting or downloading them, say, from a PC directly into flash memory. 
        The user will also have access to live multi-player games, where the participants 
        can play simultaneously.</font>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At theIntel 
        Developer Forum, In-Fusio will demonstrate three new games using Intel 
        flash memory and the Flash Data Integrator software: Pile-Up (a Tetris 
        game), 3D Maze (a 3D labyrinth) and WataRaider (a platform game like Nintendo's 
        Super Mario).</font>

        of games on mobile phones. </font>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As both 
        designer and developer, In-Fusio is the first company in the world to 
        offer WAP and connected mobile games on mobile phones. Right from the 
        start, In-Fusio stood out from conventional start-ups both in terms of 
        customers and co-workers : 9 nationalities are already represented among 
        the over-40 employees present on-site in Bordeaux working with 8 different 
        mobile phones operators in 7 different countries world wide. </font>
