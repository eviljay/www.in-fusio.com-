      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ExEn 
        allows users to download new games and extensions (levels, characters, 
        etc.) at any time. Players retain all the advantages of embedded games 
        (gameplay speed, telephone set reactivity, rich animations and graphics, 
        3D games, etc.) without the main disadvantage: the impossibility of changing 
        games.<br>
        <br>
        In-Fusio, world leader in Connected Mobile Games, used its unique position 
        among game studios, network operators and handset manufacturers to develop 
        this technoloqy.<br>
        <br>
        <b>How does ExEn work?<br>
        </b>ExEn is a new technology designed by In-Fusio that allows users to 
        download games over the mobile phone network and run them on their mobile 
        phones. ExEn must first be implemented on the mobile phone. It then handles 
        the interface between the terminal's operating system and the game program. 
        ExEn can be implemented on most current generation handsets, and can work 
        over all existing GSM networks.<br>
        <br>
        Technically, its game-dedicated Application Programming Interface (including 
        sprite display, mapping, 3D graphic functions, music and sound effects, 
        etc.) fits in seamlessly between the software and hardware layers of the 
        mobile phone. "These dedicated APIs make ExEn game execution up to 20 
        times faster than with general purpose virtual machines. This is essential 
        for high quality game play!" says Thomas Landspurg In-Fusio CTO.<br>
        <br>
        In-Fusio is already working with four of the world's leading mobile phone 
        manufacturers to integrate ExEn in their present and future generations 
        of cellphones.<br>
        <br>
        On the commercial side, In-Fusio already has the commitment from 3 major 
        cellular operators to offer ExEn games to their customers in 2001. "With 
        10 million ExEn mobile phones by the end of next year, In-Fusio becomes 
        a major player in the hand-held game device industry" says Gilles Raymond, 
        In-Fusio CEO.<br>
        <br>
        <b>ExEn Advantages<br>
        </b>With embedded games, users were originally limited to those games 
        provided by the manufacturer of their mobile phone. Thanks to ExEn, players 
        will have access to a huge library of games that they can download to 
        their telephones. Dowloaded games are then freely and instantly accessible 
        via the ExEn menu.<br>
        Players are no longer passive-they become active and truly select the 
        games they want to play, and create their own game libraries by downloading 
        programs and deleting others. <br>
        <br>
        Also, as with In-Fusio's embedded games, players benefit from interactivity 
        via the SMS or data channels. This enables them to publish their scores, 
        or receive promotional messages. As GPRS becomes available, they will 
        easily play real time multi-player games.. <br>
        <br>
        With ExEn, games like PileUp, 3D Maze and Wata Raider, which contain both 
        rich graphics and interactivity, can now be played on mobile phones, which 
        would have been impossible in WAP mode. "ExEn meets all the consumer's 
        expectations: quality of gameplay, large choice andinstant access to games 
        everywhere you go, even out of the network coverage" says Marc Lefour, 
        ExEn Product Manager.<br>
        <br>
        No matter how good a game technology is, it needs to inspire the community 
        of game developers to work with it. With the ExEn solution, In-Fusio has 
        developed the best means to easily and rapidly design games that will 
        work on all ExEn mobile phones.<br>
        <br>
        This is why the world's leading game studios have chosen to use ExEn technology 
        for their next generation of games. Among these well-known partners are 
        X, X, X, X and X.<br>
        By late 2001, In-Fusio expects that over 100 games will be available in 
        ExEn mode. <br>
        <br>
