                        <ul>
                          <li>the IN-FUSIO notice preloaded on the Mobile Telephone (if any);</li>
                          <li>these General Terms and Conditions; and</li>
                          <li>the contractual information made available to the User on IN-FUSIO's Website (www.infusio.com) and WAP site (wap.in-fusio.com).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In the event of a contradiction between the provisions of differently ranked documents, the provisions of the higher ranked document shall prevail.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>5.         OBJECT</p>
                        <p>The object of these General  Terms and Conditions is to set forth the conditions under which the User may use and access the Service.</p>
                        <p>Any use of the Service shall be subject to compliance with these General  Terms and Conditions.</p>
                        <p>The User acknowledges that he has reviewed these General  Terms and Conditions of subscription and that he accepts them without reservation.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>6.         FINANCIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>
                        <p>When using the Service, the User will be billed directly by his Mobile Telephone Service Provider for any type of Interaction made between his Mobile Telephone and the Server Centre.</p>
                        <p>When the User registers to IN-FUSIO's Service, a SMS will be sent by his Mobile Telephone, for which the User will be charged at the standard SMS tariff applied by his Mobile Telephone  Service  Provider, which the User declares to be fully aware of. </p>
                        <p>Download of Games are charged at standard DATA air-time costs as applied by the User’s Mobile Telephone Service Provider, which the User declares to be fully aware of, plus a fixed “content” charge that may vary upon the country and upon the User’ s Mobile Telephone Service Provider. </p>
                        <p>Under normal conditions, it takes approximately between three and four minutes to download a Game. The exact duration depends on the size of the Downloaded  Application and the network transmission quality of the User' 's Mobile Telephone Service Provider at that time and in the place where the User is located, as well as on the network quality of the fixed operator of the country in question. IN-FUSIO shall not be liable for Downloading times greater or less than the estimate given above.</p>
                        <p>The User is responsible for selecting his Mobile Telephone Service Provider and for communication costs based on the tariffs, terms and conditions of his provider.</p>
                        <p>All prices are presented to the User on his Mobile Telephone before any Interaction is made by the Mobile Telephone, and the User’s acceptance of that price before the Interaction starts is requested. By accepting the price of an Interaction, the User agrees to be charged directly on his Mobile Telephone Service Provider’s bill for the same price. The means of billing could vary based on the type of Interaction. For example, the “content fee” billed for a game download may be billed by the means of several premium SMS sent at the end of the download.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>7.         THE SERVICE</p>
                        <p>The Service allows a User to play Games on his Mobile Telephone that can be downloaded and updated.</p>

                        <p>The Service may be modified: new Games may be made available to the User. Moreover, IN-FUSIO may withdraw current Games from the Service.</p>
                        <p>IN-FUSIO reserves the right to change the Service in order to improve it as it deems necessary or appropriate for Service operation and/or to provide the Service to the User.</p>
                        <p>IN-FUSIO may temporarily or definitively suspend whole or any part of the Services for operational reasons at any time but will endeavor to give the User as much notice as is reasonably practical before doing so.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>9.         SUBSCRIPTION</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Important: </p>
                        <p>Depending on the memory capabilities of your Mobile Telephone,  one to several  embedded Games (permanently installed on your telephone) are available. Your Mobile Telephone can also include preloaded games (games pre-installed on your telephone, but that can be erased by new downloaded games). One Game may be downloaded at a time, and will either replace a preloaded game or the game previously downloaded. Once a Game has been downloaded, it is stored in your telephone and you can play it off-line for as long as you wish. Please recall that each Game Download is subject to the financial terms and conditions set forth in Article 6.</p>
